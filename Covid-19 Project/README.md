## Insights Gained
1. South Africa was the hardest hit by the pandemic with 4,072,697 confirmed cases, contributing to 31% of the total covid-19 cases in Africa.
2. Despite contributing to 31% of the total cases, South Africa only accounts for 4.2% of the total population, which would suggest a disproportionate impact of the pandemic on South Africas.
3. South Africa also conducted the most tests in Africa, with a total of 25,637,671 tests done, which accounts for 22.7% of the total tests done in the continent. This could at least partly explain the disproportionate impact of the pandemic.
4. 7 out of the 10 countries with highest covid counts also conducted the most test.
5. January 2022 was the month that saw the highest number of Covid-19 cases in Africa, with 1,433,745 confirmed cases.
